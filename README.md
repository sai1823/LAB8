LAB 8 Interactive Graph with Shiny

This is a Shiny app that allows users to visualize the iris dataset using different types of plots. 
The UI consists of three panels: Histograms, Scatter Plot, and Violin Plot.

In the Histograms panel, users can select the variable they want to plot on the x-axis, the color of the histogram bars, and the bin size. 
The histogram is generated using ggplot2.

In the Scatter Plot panel, users can select two variables for the x-axis and y-axis, and the color of the points. 
The scatter plot is generated using ggplot2, and the user-selected variables are selected from the iris dataset using dplyr.

In the Violin Plot panel, users can select the variable they want to plot on the x-axis and the color of the violin plot. 
The violin plot is generated using ggplot2.
